To run the code you can do either of the following:

1. Run using a console and command line
2. Run in an IDE

We will outline both:

1. Run Using Command Line

Open a terminal and run the following command:

python eigenfaces.py

With the following flags:

--input
    Path to input directory of images used for training. Default is "photos"
--face
    Path to face detector file. Default is "face_detector"
--confidence
    Minimum confidence probability to detect faces. Default is 0.5
--num-components
    Number of principal components in the PCA. Default is 150
--visualize
    Whether to visualize (1) the eigenfaces and mean face or not (-1). Default is -1

This file will train a model using the MUCT dataset and will select one test sample and determine the confidence level
of the prediction. The sample comes from the MUCT dataset so it may be a face that the model has seen before.

2. Run Using IDE

Open the file research_test.py in your preferred IDE. You can set all the parameters for the analysis in the "args" block
including the sample image that you want to test the model against for predictive power. This file will train a model using
the MUCT dataset, however you will choose which test sample you want by setting the "test_photo" value in the args block.
We will use this file to predict the closest match to the test photo and provide the confidence level to determine if there
are any biases in the model training for specific races and genders.
